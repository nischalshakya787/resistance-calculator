# Resistance Calculator

## Overview

Resistance Calculator is a React-based project that helps users calculate the resistance value of a resistor based on its color bands. It's designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, allowing users to select the colors of the bands and obtain the corresponding resistance value.

This project was created to apply the knowledge gained during the 2nd semester of [Your Institution/Program Name], showcasing practical implementation of concepts learned.

## Features

- Allows users to select the color bands of a resistor.
- Calculates the resistance value based on the selected color bands.
- Supports resistance calculation up to 5 digits.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
